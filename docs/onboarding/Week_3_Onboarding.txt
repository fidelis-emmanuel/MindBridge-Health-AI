## 💡 CRITICAL CONTEXT TO PRESERVE

### What Makes Me Different (Competitive Advantage)
**CS grads have:** 4 years of algorithms, coding fundamentals, computer science theory  
**I have:** 10 years behavioral health experience (IRREPLACEABLE)  
**The Combination:** "You can teach a CS grad to use FastAPI in 6 months. You cannot teach 10 years of behavioral health experience. I bring both, and that's rare."

### Key Psychological Insights
- **Fear of "not ready"** was the main blocker (not technical gaps)
- **Systematic organization** prevents goal drift
- **Speed matters:** Every week costs $3,173 in lost income opportunity
- **80% ready is enough** - Perfect is the enemy of hired
- **Domain expertise is the differentiator** for Healthcare AI roles

### Interview Readiness Assessment
- **Technical Skills:** 90% ✅
- **Domain Expertise:** 100% ✅ (10 years clinical)
- **Portfolio:** 85% ✅ (backend complete, frontend pending)
- **Communication:** 80% (STAR stories identified, scripts pending)
- **OVERALL:** 85% interview-ready (ahead of schedule)

---

## 📊 ECONOMIC CONTEXT

### Current Situation
- **Current Salary:** $35,000/year = $673/week
- **Target Salary:** $200,000/year = $3,846/week
- **Weekly Opportunity Cost:** $3,173 per week of delay

### Timeline Economics
- **Original Plan:** Apply Week 12 (12 weeks × $3,173 = $38,076 lost)
- **Revised Plan:** Apply Week 4 (4 weeks × $3,173 = $12,692 lost)
- **Savings:** $25,384 by accelerating 8 weeks

### Salary Negotiation Position
- **Minimum Acceptable:** $150K
- **Target:** $200K (realistic with portfolio + experience)
- **Stretch:** $250K (achievable with multiple offers)
- **Justification:** Healthcare AI Engineer market ($150K-$220K) + 10 years clinical experience premium + production deployment + HIPAA expertise

## 🎓 LEARNING PATTERNS THAT WORK

### What's Working
1. **Spaced repetition:** 100% retention over 4 days proves system works
2. **Daily structure:** Morning quiz → afternoon coding → evening commit
3. **Production-first:** Build real systems, not just learn concepts
4. **Comprehensive documentation:** COMPLETE_ROADMAP.md prevents drift
5. **Small wins compound:** 4 perfect days → unstoppable confidence

### Mentor Approach
- **Direct, not coddling:** "You're scared of being ready" vs "you're not ready"
- **Systematic, not motivational:** Organization beats motivation
- **Action-oriented:** "Deploy today" not "learn deployment concepts"
- **Context-aware:** Always tie to clinical experience and patient safety
- **Economically grounded:** Remind of $3,173/week opportunity cost

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### HIPAA Compliance (Always)
- ✅ reports/ folder in .gitignore (NEVER commit patient data)
- ✅ .env files in .gitignore (NEVER commit API keys)
- ✅ Use environment variables for all credentials
- ✅ Audit logging on all data access
- ✅ Encryption at rest and in transit

### File Handling Rules
- **User uploads:** `/mnt/user-data/uploads` (read-only)
- **Work directory:** `/home/claude` (temporary scratch space)
- **Final outputs:** `/mnt/user-data/outputs` (share with user via present_files)

### Git Workflow
- ✅ Check `git status` before committing
- ✅ Verify reports/ is NOT staged
- ✅ Professional commit messages (multi-line with details)
- ✅ Push after every major milestone
